Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest ECMAScript features and syntax by transforming the code into an older version of JavaScript.

# How does Babel convert HTML code in React into valid code?
Babel is like a translator for JavaScript. It changes JSX into regular JavaScript that computers can read. JSX is cool because it lets us write code that looks like HTML but stays inside our JavaScript. Babel helps make it work for computers.

Props (optional): An object containing properties that will be passed to the element.

Children (optional): The content or child elements of the created element.
